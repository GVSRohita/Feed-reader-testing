===========================================
# Project Overview

This project is a web-based application containing following test-suites:

- RSS Feeds
- The menu
- Initial Entries
- New Feed Selection

## How to run this project:
- Download [this file] (https://github.com/GVSRohita/Feed-reader-testing) or clone the repository into your local machine
- Open the `index.html` file in a web browser, preferably **Google Chrome**
- There are _Jasmine_ library files loaded in the repository. Hence, you can view the specs along with errors in the code, if any

## Sources that helped me do my project:
