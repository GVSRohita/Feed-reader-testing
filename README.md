Feed-Reader Testing - by G.V.Sri Rohita
===========================================
# Project Overview

This project is a web-based application containing following test-suites:

- RSS Feeds
- The menu
- Initial Entries
- New Feed Selection

## How to run this project:
- Download [this file] (https://github.com/gvsrohita/Feed-reader-testing) or clone the repository from `Github` into your local machine. Of course, it can be run from [here] (https://gvsrohita.github.io/Feed-reader-testing/) too
- Open the `index.html` file in a web browser, preferably **Google Chrome**
- There are _Jasmine_ library files loaded in the repository. Hence, you can view the specs along with errors in the code, if any

## Sources that helped me do my project:

- [Jasmine Documentation] (https://jasmine.github.io/)
- Inputs from friends in [slack] (https://slack.com/) and `Udacity forums`
